The Main Approach of the TA is 'Find out the Time Complexity without writing the Code'
Steps for Theorotical Analysis:
    1. Figure out the solutions
    2. Try to find the formula(polynomial) of the solution
    3. Use the Big O Notation Rules in the formula
        a) Remove the Cofficients from it
        b) Find the Highest Degree in the said polynomial
